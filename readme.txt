Shipment Tracking Plugin for WooCommerce. Order tracking for various shipping services.

== Description ==

= Introduction =
WooCommerce Shipment Tracking Plugin helps to integrate tracking functionalities to your WooCommerce based store. By using this shipment tracking extension, you can provide your customers an easy way to track their shipments for various shipping services.

Our plugin gives the flexibility to easily add or remove shipping services providers from the admin settings. A complete list of pre-populated shipping services is available in the premium version mentioned below.

= How tracking feature works =
Before changing status of the order to ‘completed’, shop admin can add WooCommerce order tracking details by selecting Shipping Company and adding tracking id in the order details page.

<li>Set Tracking ID from order admin page ( excluding shipment date. )</li>
<li>WooCommerce Shipping Tracking status on customer's individual order page</li>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many shipping carriers can I configure for tracking with this plugin..? =
This plugin supports only one shipping carrier. You can configure any one shipping carrier by providing the name and the tracking URL of that carriers using this plugin.
However, if you require multiple shipping carriers and want to provide shipment tracking for multiple shipping carriers, you can try the Premium Version of the plugin. It comes with 80+ pre-configured shipping carriers and you can choose to add or remove any shipping carriers in that plugin.
= How will the customers track their orders..? =
WooCommerce Shipment Tracking plugin provides the tracking details along with the tracking link in the customer’s My Accounts page. The customers can log in to the My Accounts page and track their orders using the tracking link.
= How do I add tracking for a shipping service  =
In the basic version, you can use a single shipping carrier. In the premium plugin, you can set up as many tracking URLs as possible. Here is an [article](https://www.xadapter.com/setting-woocommerce-shipment-tracking-pro-plugin/) that will help you to do that.
